            <img src="images/techcon-history.jpg" alt="TechCon founders at the first conference in 2010" width="600" height="400">
            <p>TechCon was founded in 2010 by a group of Silicon Valley engineers who wanted to create a conference that focused on practical, cutting-edge technology rather than corporate marketing. What began as a 200-person gathering in a San Francisco hotel has grown into one of the world's premier tech events, attracting over 10,000 attendees annually.</p>
            <p>Over the years, TechCon has been at the forefront of major technological shifts, from the cloud computing revolution to the AI boom. Our commitment to showcasing genuine innovation rather than hype has made us a favorite among developers and technologists worldwide.</p>
